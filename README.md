## Disclaimer

I have created this app because the official [F1 TV app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.formulaone.production)
does not officially support Android TV and even after sideloading it, it's not usable with a remote.
The official website is also not easily usable with a remote. If in the future an official application
would be available, I will happily abandon this one.

This will always be a free and open source app.

Do what you want with it : use it or modify it.
