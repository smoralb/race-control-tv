Onboard channels when available are supported, as well as technical channels like the tracker channel.

Multiple channels playback is not supported. Audio selection (language or no commentary) is supported.

## Attention
F1 has now (on Google Chrome) a native cast button, that works pretty decent, and also works with the new APIs (witch this app currently **does not** support

## Disclaimer

I have created this app because the official [F1 TV app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.formulaone.production)
does not officially support Android TV and even after sideloading it, it's not usable with a remote.
The official website is also not easily usable with a remote. If in the future an official application
would be available, I will happilly abandonned this one.

This will allways be a free and open source app.

Do what you want with it : use it or modify it.
